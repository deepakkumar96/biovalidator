Valid fasta format
One of the most frequent errors with uploading the data is incorrect file format. We recommend fasta format for all the sequence data to be uploaded.

In particular, please check the following things:

There should be no spaces or tabs at the start or ends of the lines
The identifier line should begin with a greater than sign ">", and only one line is allowed
Typically most bioinformatics applications use the first word after the > as the identifier for the sequence. Its nice (but not essential) if this is unique
In the sequence lines (not header lines), spaces and numbers are removed.

These are the rules I've currently implemented and working on; Please verify these rules:

1. First Line must start with '>'
2. Allow multiple sequences in a file
4. Strict checking for Nucleic-Acid and Amino-Acid sequences
5. Sequences letters must follow 'IUB/IUPAC'
6. Warning on exceeding 80 letters in a line
7. Empty files will be considered invalid
8. whitespaces and empty-lines are allowed and ignored
9. Each header must be non-empty and unique
10. Rules for Nucleotide sequences:
	> Valid letters : 'ACGT' + 'NUKSYMWRBDHV' + '-'

10. Rules for Amino Acid(Protein):
	> Valid letters : 'A-Z' + '-' + '.'

Quenstions :
1. Which part of the header line is sequence-id?
	a. Header format is not same across all the databases.
	   Ex, UniProtKB: sp|Q4R572-2|1433B_MACFA Isoform Short of 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha OS=Macaca fascicularis OX=9541 GN=YWHAB
	   	   UniRef   : UniRef50_Q9K794 Putative AgrB-like protein n=2 Tax=Bacillus TaxID=1386 RepID=AGRB_BACHD
	   	   UniParc  : >UPI0000000005 status=active

3. Should numbers allowed
